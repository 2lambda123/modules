Running Rockstar Halo Finder, Merger Trees, and make parents.

1) Create configuration file appropriate for your rockstar run in
   Rockstar folder
2) Update file paths in file directories
3*) run ./RunAll.sh

Wait until it all finishes!

* suggested you use screen, or qsub as you may have to start all over
 again if the job is halted due to loss of internet.
